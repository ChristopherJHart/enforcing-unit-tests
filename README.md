# Granular Enforcement of Python Unit Test Coverage through Code Inspection

This repository tracks a Proof of Concept (PoC) where we use code inspection to enforce granular unit test coverage for a Python software application that may grow in size and complexity over time.

A blog post that explains this concept in more detail can be found [here](https://chrisjhart.com/Enforcing-Python-Unit-Test-Coverage/).
